# Spring PetClinic on Kotlin with Flyway

The application was created to test and demonstrate the features of [JPA Buddy](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/) – a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA designed to make the use of JPA easier.
The entity model and data repositories are taken from the original [Spring PetClinic Sample Application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).

Project language – [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Database versioning – [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/).
