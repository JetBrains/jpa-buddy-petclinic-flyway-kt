# Spring PetClinic on Kotlin with Flyway

### Note
The application was created to test and demonstrate the functionality of [JPA Buddy](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/) plugin. 
Entity model and data repositories are taken from the original [Spring PetClinic Sample Application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).

Project language - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). Database versioning - [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/).

### Used functionality from JPA Buddy plugin

* Create entity
* Create entity attribute
* Create Spring data repository
* Create repository method (query including)
* Automatic generation of Flyway versioned migration: comparing JPA model to database
